“A simple, dynamic extension of Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT)” presents a mathematical model of individual level decision making. The narrative motivates the model as the process an employee would use to determine what to work on or what goals to focus on. The author’s intent is to build on TMT, which already considers the utility function of the actor, along with hyperbolic discounting, expectancy theory, cumulative prospect theory and need theory, by considering the “environment” when sampling when sampling options and comparing prior payoffs. This is a good idea. That the TMT model does not consider context is a weakness. What is unclear is what exactly Goal Sampling is modeling and how it works. The issue is a function of the writing and the selection of examples (and literature) used throughout the manuscript. There were so many tangents and explanations sprinkled through the text that it was difficult to keep straight the contribution of the Goal Sampling and what was unique to this model. 

A major reorganization would go far in making this paper more clear. For instance, what is meant by “environment” was not well defined and the literature review that pertained to environment seemed like a tangent (top of page 6). The author should be careful to clearly and explicitly define all concepts and stick to only literature that relates to the model. There must be literature related to environment or context in decision making more relevant than the animal examples used. While reading this section I actually wondered if maybe the author intended for environment to mean something other than situational environment. 

Thank you for the recommendation and opportunity to make the paper more clear. After going back through the paper, I agree that my original discussion of the environment was confusing. I have significantly updated and trimmed the introduction to the environment section so that only material that directly relates to the paper is discussed. 

Another note is that the environment is a major piece I wanted to incorporate, but it wasn't the only aspect I wanted to focus on. In the prior paper, I introduced the environment first. This time, I pushed the environment section down to emphasize other features first -- hopefully doing so improved clarity. You can see the changes on page BLAH.


The author’s strategy to review TMT before discussing Goal Sampling is a good idea. The issue is that it does not go far enough and the way it is done is confusing. Readers of the Journal of Mathematical Sociology may not be familiar with TMT or literature that surrounds it, or notation used to describe models. It is not that the literature is not covered, but that it is covered in a very non-linear manner.  The TMT model has many elements, many of which are also elements of other approaches. It might be more effective if the author just introduce each feature he feels pertain to his question, cover these elements, mention that TMT covers many, but fails to consider environment, and then demonstrate how the TMT model can be extended to include this new consideration. 

This is a very good suggestion. Following the introduction, the paper now gets right into important features for goal choice and how TMT covers some but not all of those features. The rest of the paper is then framed around satisfying the remaining criteria. I believe this simple suggestion went a long way to improve the clarity of the paper, I hope you agree.

It would also be very useful if the author would demonstrate the benefit of the Goal Sampling model with a comparison to TMT. 

Great idea. The discussion section now includes an example where both TMT and GST are compared to more clearly demonstrate their differences. 

Related to this, the examples selected often did not work well to clarify ideas. Part of the issue is that there are many different illustrations and examples. A more effective approach might be to select a motivating example and use that one example to illustrate the benefit of each model element. 

The suggestions above, in my opinion, went a long way to improve the paper's clarity. It's actually my preference to use many different illustrations rather than one consistent example throughout -- I think it gives the reader a chance to see the ideas from many angles. My hope is that by incorporating your earlier suggestions this one becomes less of an issue. 

One final issue is relevance to sociology. The motivating example is related to a work scenario, and so it is plausible that this model might relate to organizational theory, but no element of the model, literature review or discussion relates to sociological concepts. For publication in a sociology journal the author may want to select a motivating example that pertains to sociology.

Thank you for the suggestion. You are correct in that the paper and many of the examples are meant to connect to organizational theory. Ultimately, the paper is about individuals selecting goals so my examples and writing is going to focus on that topic. The paper now includes an example in the discussion section that hopefully ties more directly with sociology: navigating work vs family relationships and goals. That said, even within that example the core notion is an individual selecting goals. If you have suggestions about which concepts from sociology would make for better examples I would be happy to hear and try to incorporate them. 





# Things I notice after re-reading the paper
- opening: what are the core things I care about representing?
- TMT. It cannot cover the core things I care about representing (vancouver; it must have these things). Here we go
- dynamics before environment
- environment: just say what I want to say and cite as backing...don't explain the studies. Use theories as evidence rather than phrases. 

- a change is coming. what other things inform this process? Experience of actually sampling the goal. Your feedback, your reward. 
- incorporate that into utility. 



# Points I want to represent that TMT can and cannot account for:

(a) Neal, Vallard, Vancouver, 2017
1) dynamic process
2) formal (mathematical representation of the processes thought to be responsible for observed phenomena)
3) environment constrains which goals are available

(b) Simon (parable of ant)
complexity of agent can largely been seen as complexity of the environment in which he finds himself

(c) Simon 1956
simple representation: agent has limited capacities, and when we take into account the environment it makes the specification even simpler

simplications for describing behavior may not only depend on the characteristics of the agent (sensory, neural, etc) but also on the structure of the environment.

By carefully studying the environment, we could descover mechanisms used in decision making

to understand an individual's behavior you must understand the distribution of goal-relevant objects in the environment

What is the environment
- not interested in describing physical objective world in its totality
- describe aspects that are relevant to the lifespace of the agent

(d) deshon gillespie 2005
to understand action it is not enough to understand the person or the situation. To understand an individaul's actions, it is necessary to understand how the person's goal structure affects the perception of the situation and how this perception further activates goals that result in actions.

(e) deshon rench 2009
feedback does not need to be a fundamental component in self regulation. Feedback is unnecessary if the individual has knowledge of internal states, the ability to perceive goal-relevant aspects of the environment, and the ability to learn associations between actions and changes in the environment. 

core questions that must be addressed by explanations of self regulation
1) what is regulated? action, behavior, emotion, congition, goals, self
2) how does the model incorporate multiple goals? how are goals prioritized?
3) how does regulation occur? how are actions selected? what is the action selection mechanism? How do goals relate to what is selected?
4) how does the individual respond to both internal and external dynamics? if small changes in goal-relevant environment or internal states produce giant behavioral changes, then you would have behavioarl chaos and dithering

to understand an individual's behavior you must understand the distribution of goal-relevant objects in the environment

handbook
family structures are increasingly complex, giving rise to "blended famillies" where new partners bring together children from previous marraiges or relationships. 
with globalization, especially development of global labor markerts, families are often dispersed through different societies and, while they retain family ties, their familial structures are stretched in spatial terms.
