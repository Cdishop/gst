\f0\fs24 \cf0 Goal choices are at the forefront of an employee's work day, but our understanding of them is limited by the unrealistic assumptions and common criticisms in some of our goal choice theories. In this paper, I discuss our theories and models related to goal choices, unpack the critiques, limitations, and assumptions embedded in them, and then present goal sampling theory (GST) and discuss how it addresses these issues. GST draws from temporal motivational theory (TMT), sampling models of impression formation, and organizational theory on how the environment constrains behavior and situates aspects of each into a formal representation of goal sampling. \
